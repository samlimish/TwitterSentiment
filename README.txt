DS PROJECT IDEA BRAINSTORM

sentiment analysis was pretty interesting. 

If we could make something like that but get people's general sentiment changes during the week, and looking at like a year round of sentiments. 
This way we could see changes throughout the day of the week as well as seasonal changes. (people might be happy as a new season starts, spring is always happy, summer fun, pumpkin spice latte, and snow)
(Hate mondays, then whatever tuesday, hump day, thursday, happy friday, woot saturday, meh sunday type of a deal) 
Geo-location to see which states do well or have drastic changes in sentiments as seasons change. (allergies could have a lot of effect; texas may not see as much happy snow sentiments as winter approaches.)

if possible, see if i can grab individual's age group as well as gender. 


In the map viewer, have the u.s. map and have a drag bar that shows the change throughout the year. almost like a forecast map, have different colors to represent the mood. Maybe if i set the vader sentiment values to just single handedly represent a color spectrum, it could show gradient changes in color schemes throughout the map.
